## Languages

Although Chimpa has very little text, it does have an easy expandable language system. If you want to contribute modify the file `js/langs.js` always respecting it's structure, then send me a pull request. The sentences need to fit in the required space, so please, test your translation before, for instance, in dev tools of your browser.
